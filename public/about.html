<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello! My name is Tyler Leach. I am originally from Steubenville, Ohio but I grew up in Arlington, Texas. 
  Right out of highschool I wanted to pursue a career in the medical field, so for ten years I worked in many
  different medical settings trying my best to help people and make a difference. Ive held different positions 
  throughout the years but my favorite would be a surgical tech. One of the greatest lessons I learned during
  my time in medicine is that what you do is more than a job, its an extension of yourself. How you 
  treat others, and how you carry yourself, can have a ripple effect that truly changes lives, no matter how 
  small the gesture or task may seem.
    Although the medical field was fruitful and fulfilling I still had an underlying feeling that I could do more.
   I didn't want to just help people, I  wanted to create as well. Technology has always been a passion of mine, 
   whether it was researching the latest gadgets, gaming, or programming, I've always been curious about technology and innovation. 
   My goals as a professionalas well as personal are to be reliable, honest, diligent, and most importantly; to make a difference.
